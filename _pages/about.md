I am a Ph.D. student (since 2019) in the School of Sofware at Shandong University, advised by [Prof. Yilong Yin](http://mla.sdu.edu.cn/ylyin-cn.html). Click [here](https://zhyhan.github.io/files/CV-Zhongyi.pdf) to view my up-to-date CV.

My current research interests include artificial intelligence and machine learning, especially in robust machine learning. I also devote to applying cutting-edge algorithms to medical image analysis.
