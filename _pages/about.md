From January 2024, I am a postdoctoral research fellow at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), working with Prof. Xin Gao. From April 2023 to January 2024, I was a postdoctoral research fellow at Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) and Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), working with Prof. Tongliang Liu and Prof. Kun Zhang. Before that, I received my Ph.D. at Shandong University in March 2023 (early graduation), advised by Prof. Yilong Yin. Between 2019 and 2020, I had the opportunity to be a visiting student at the LAMDA group of Nanjing University, led by Prof. Zhi-Hua Zhou. Earlier, from 2016 to 2018, I was a visiting student in Prof. Shuo Li's group at Western University in Canada. In 2018, I also undertook an internship at Baidu. My academic foundation was laid at Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, where I obtained my Bachelor's degree in 2016 and my Master's degree in 2019, both in Biomedical Engineering. Throughout this period, Prof. Benzheng Wei served as my mentor.

My primary academic interest lies in advancing the theory and algorithms for robust machine learning in open-world environments. I am also dedicated to fostering the growth of AI for Science (biomedical science) and firmly believe in the essential research potential of open scenarios within AI for Science. My ultimate academic aspiration is to enhance the robustness and generalization capability of machine learning in non-stationary and imperfect settings. I aim to ensure that machine learning can handle a wide range of abnormal and complex environmental shifts, paving the way for human-trusted, widely adopted intelligent systems.
