I am a Ph.D. student (since 2019) in the School of Sofware at Shandong University, advised by [Prof. Yilong Yin](http://mla.sdu.edu.cn/ylyin-cn.html). Click [here](https://zhyhan.github.io/files/CV-Zhongyi.pdf) to view my up-to-date CV.

My primary academic interest is developing the theory and algorithm of robust machine learning. I also devote to promoting the development of AI-empowered healthcare, especially to applying cutting-edge robust algorithms to assist radiologists in achieving fast and light medical image analysis. My ultimate goal is to improve the robustness and generalization ability of machine learning in non-stationary and imperfect environments, make machine learning can easily cope with various abnormal and complex environmental changes, so as to realize human-trusted, large-scale popularized intelligent systems.

My research principle is "Theory without practice is empty, practice without theory is blind".
